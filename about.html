I am originally from Corpus Christi, Texas and now reside in San Antonio, Texas. This blog I am writing is about Disney World Theme Park in Orlando, Florida. I am a Disney Fanatic and love all things Disney. I will write about how to plan for a Disney World trip, tips, information and stays of the theme park. Iâ€™m a frequent visitor of Disney World since 2015. 

I had the idea of going to Disney when I was 18 (2012) but had thought that it would be too much to plan the trip. So now I want to help others feel and enjoy the magic that Disney World has to offer. If you would like more details or information, please feel free to contact me.
