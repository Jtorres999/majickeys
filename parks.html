So now that you have booked a trip to Disney (or are still in the planning stages) let me tell you about the Disney World Parks (Orlando, Florida location). 
Disney World has 4 theme parks. For each of these parks you must have a park ticket (109.00 plus tax and price varies depending on the day) and if visiting one day you must pay for a parking ticket (varies from $30-$55), unless staying at the resorts (free parking). 
Each park is centered around different Disney movie themes, characters, and rides. I will be describing each park below. So, buckle up and enjoy the ride.

<div class="footer">
  <p>These are the four parks at Disney World. I do recommend that if you do plan to visit all four parks to spend one day in each. The parks are big and there is just so much to view that you might not get to see the whole park in a day. But regardless of what you decide, all these parks are fun and whether alone or with family and friends it is a wonderful time.  </p>
