												   Hello there, I am Juliana. If you are here, it is because you want to go to Disney World, the “happiest place in the world” and you want to learn a few steps to planning. Let me start by showing you how you can book a trip to Disney World. By following the steps below, you will be closer to booking your trip and feeling the magic of Disney.
</div>
</h1>
	
<div style="margin-left: 50%"> <table> <ol> <li>Book your trip to Disney World by going to the Disney World website (https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/).</li> <li> Once on their website, add the dates and individuals you will be taking on your trip. Leave the resorts on the search bar for all resort hotels so that you can see all the resorts available. Then press search. </li> <li>Click on the available resorts that better suit your needs. Once you click on the resort that suits you, it will show you different options, such as a family room or an accessibility room.</li> <li>After you have picked your resort, you will pick your park tickets. There are many options you can pick; you can go to all four parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios) or just choose one ticket. You can also choose to buy a parkhopper ticket to go to all four parks in one day.</li> <li>On the last page, you will have the option to add a dining plan (paid in advance meals), memory hopper (photos taken by a photographer at the parks), and ground transportation (car rentals). <li>Once finished, you will be prompted to a screen that requires you to start a Disney account.</li> <li>With the Disney account created, you will add your payment method.</li> <li> Once the payment method is confirmed, you have booked a trip to Disney!</li> </ol> </table> </div>
